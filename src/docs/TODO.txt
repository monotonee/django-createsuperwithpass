Add random password generation option with output to stdout?

A wad of obtuse and unecessary code was apparently created for patch 10080. It looks like an
optparse idiosyncrasy coupled with a very old version of Django. This code desperately needs to be
cleaned up. Perhaps I'll submit a pull request.
