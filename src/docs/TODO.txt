Add random password generation option with output to stdout?
Break up Command interactive and noninteractive handlers into separate classes?
Catch IntegrityError in save method? ValidationError as well?


A wad of obtuse and unecessary code was apparently created for patch 10080. It looks like an
optparse idiosyncrasy coupled with a very old version of Django. This code desperately needs to be
cleaned up. Perhaps I'll submit a pull request.
    See:
        https://code.djangoproject.com/ticket/10080
        https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/core/management/__init__.py
        https://github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/core/management/base.py

In docs:
    username validation, including blank and unique, left to field's clean() method. createsuperuser
        no longer enforces non-empty usernames. Uniqueness check is executed for convenience since
        model validation requires completed model
    It does NOT appear that username validation is performed if username is passed via command
        line option.
    For validation errors or other exceptions, CommandError shoud be raised for values passed via
        command line, but simple strings should be output to stderr when in interactive input loop.
